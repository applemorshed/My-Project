My project Summary.

Project Name: Person Database with Oracle PL/SQL
Objective: 
  This project Code is written in PL/SQL. Designed and implemented an Oracle database to store country citizenship data.
  Used stored procedures, functions, and views to store and retrieve data for reporting.
Project Summary: 
  The main idea is to create a central database where we can store each individual’s information, 
such as last name, first name, birth date, SSN, address, phone number, job information, car information, physical description, bank information, education information, family relationship and so on. The practical use of this database is huge. This database stores each individual information. If someone reports any suspicious car license plate number, 
immediately the police can find the owners of the car. If police receive an emergency call (911), the police can identify the person. This data set has relational information of a person. It is possible to find all the family members of a 
person. If someone wants to open a bank account, the bank can collect all the necessary information from the central database and open a bank account within a minute. If the Government wants to send information to the people in an area, they can send 
Email or SMS only that particular area’s people. Fx: Emergency power outrage, water work, Construction work, etc.

Project Name: Python BackUp file system using WatchDog
Objective: 
  To create a backup file system by using Python
Project Summary:

Project Name: Comparing logistic regression and decision tree on the titanic data set
Objective: In this project, we are using machine learning to compare and find the best model. We are using the titanic 
data set which we take from Kaggle.
Project Summary: In this project, we use a systematic approach from collecting data, arrange the dataset, cleaning and replace
the missing value, find the suitable model and train the model using logistic regression and as well as decision tree approach 
and compare which model is works at its best.

Project Name: Recreation of Hans Rosling gapminder world population data by using Tableau
Objective: The target of this project is to recreate Hans Rosling's gapminder world population data. This is one of the famous works by Hans Rosling and it is considered as the beginning of data visualization. 
Project Summary: Collecting the data and place it in x, y, and z-axis where the z-axis is time. we compare the change of  
the population of each country at different times point also predict future change.
